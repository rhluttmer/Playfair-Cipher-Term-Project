What each file is:

encryptDecrypt.py : encrypts and decrypts the playfair cipher (no graphics for now),
you just need to call the function in main in that file

classes.py : handles all classes for OOP

findKeyPseudo : brainstorming of ideas for how to find the key table based on
an input of plaintext and ciphertext

badCrackTable.py : a REALLY brute force attempt at finding the key table. Uses backtracking,
places letters and then only check is that there are no diagraphs contained within
the table that encrypt to the wrong thing

crackTable1.py : an attempt at improving the backtracking. Starts by gathering
a fair amount of information about the letters, what should be in rows/cols etc.
But in the implementation, not all of that information is used effectively
which makes the program still go way too slow.

letterDictHelpers.py : at the beginning of crackTable1, a letter dict is made
to store a bunch of info about the letters, what they are in rows/cols with,
their neighbors, etc. These are helper functions for that

crackTable2.py : an attempt to improve the shortcomings of crackTable1
