What each file is:

encryptDecrypt.py : encrypts and decrypts the playfair cipher (no graphics for now),
you just need to call the function in main in that file

classes.py : handles all classes for OOP

letterDictHelpers.py : at the beginning of crackTable1, a letter dict is made
to store a bunch of info about the letters, what they are in rows/cols with,
their neighbors, etc. These are helper functions for that

crackTable2.py : user enters plaintext and ciphertext, returns a keygrid that works

crackTableCorrectness.txt: A log of inputs and outputs used to test the program

encDecGraphics.py: This will eventually be the main program with which the
user interacts, it is at a very beginning stage for now

design proposal / storyboard: the required tp design proposal and storyboard
